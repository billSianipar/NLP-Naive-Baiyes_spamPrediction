# Natural Language Processing method on spam classification.

`This notebook shows that Natural Language Processing (NLP) method and Naive-Bayes machine learning method can be used to predict or classify a comment in text form as a spam or not a spam.`

`As programming language cannot process text (or string) directly, a means of converter from string is needed. The NLP method contains CountVectorizer that can convert the string to a vector, and TF-IDF that is used to get some sort of notation, which is represented as weigh (takes form of a number). TF-IDF can be used to show a word's importance (weight) in the document of corpus (collection of documents).`

`The dataset used is from Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine (UCI).`
